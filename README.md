# OCR-Optical-Character-Recognition-
This system solves the problem for recognizing and reading License Plate Number from Automobiles using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV. 
I have used some random vehicle images from Google and wrote a code to recognize the number plate using OpenCV Contour Detection, followed by reading the number from the plate.
